# unit-4-game

This is a simple game where the player pits one user character against 4 enemies. All characters are from the Star Wars Universe with more to come!

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and open the index.html file will launch the game.

## How To Play

Choose a player character from the left grouping. Each character has its individual HP (Hit Points), Attack Power and Counter Attack Power. Choose an inital enemy from the right character grouping. Once you are satisfied with your character (left) and your first enemy character (right), press the attack button to begin the battle! The battles will be tough! The player character gains Attack Power equal to its initial Attack Power every turn. The player exchanges blows with the CPU character every time the attack button is pressed. Once an enemy is defeated a random character is chosen from the pool to take his or her place. Once 4 enemy characters are defeated, you win! If at any time the player character's HP is reduced to 0 or lower, the player loses. There is no heal function! Defeat 4 consecutive character to win!
